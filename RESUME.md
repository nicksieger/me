## Summary

I am a seasoned developer with over 20 years software development experience spanning enterprise, open source, and software-as-a-service. I enjoy solving problems in a collaborative, continuous inprovement environment with a focus on developer efficiency and making the process of writing software full of enjoyment and discovery.  I flourish most in situations where I can have an impact on the developer experience by writing software to be used by other software developers, from open source software to external API design and implementation to internal tooling and CI/CD pipelines.
